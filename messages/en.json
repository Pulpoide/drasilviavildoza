        "personal_story": "My path was not linear. As a multi-time breast cancer survivor, I experienced firsthand the fear, uncertainty, and profound impact that hormonal changes have on our identity and energy. I understood that surviving is only the first step; the true goal is to regain fulfillment and feel in control of our bodies again.",

        "method_desc": "Today, my practice focuses on Longevity Medicine and Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). I do not believe in standard solutions. Each patient receives what I call a 'bespoke treatment': a strategically designed plan based on profound clinical analysis. We combine high-quality hormones with specific pharmaceuticals to ensure each organism receives exactly what it needs to balance safely and effectively.",
        "promise": "My purpose is to help you rediscover your vitality. Hormonal balance not only improves energy, libido, and sleep quality; it is an investment in your cardiovascular, bone, and cognitive health for the years ahead. Whether in Argentina or Brazil, my commitment is to accompany you through your most powerful stage with science, safety, and empathy."
